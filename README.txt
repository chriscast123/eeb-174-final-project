Pseudocode:
1.) input & output

xx = get user file(input)
yy = the number of unique species
Output message displaying uniqe number of species from file




2.) data manipulation over a loop

import file
set range of data that you want to analyze/manipulate
	if data is over 90 lines, say too much data to analyze at the moment
	if data is at 90 lines or less, display data set to analyze/manipulate
